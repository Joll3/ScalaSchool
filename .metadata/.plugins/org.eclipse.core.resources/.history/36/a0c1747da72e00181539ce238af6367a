# This assignment asks you to find the most frequent value in a data array.
        
# Namely, you must find the most frequently occurring value in a data
# array that starts at memory address $0 and contains $1 words.
# The most frequent value must be stored in register $2.
# Complete and submit the part delimited by "----" and indicated
# by a "nop" below.

# Here is some wrapper code to test your solution:

        mov     $0, >test_data  # set up the address where to get the data
        mov     $1, >test_len   # set up address where to get the length
        loa     $1, $1          # load the length from memory to $1

# Your solution starts here ...
